I mainly work off of the lecture slides and out of the book while developing these algorithms, as i am still learning the laguage i did a few times consult W3 school, my favorite location for all python help

Notes/ Warnings:
My greedy search algorithms right now are looking the best
Still working on developing the rest
AStar and Ucost seem to be a little off when it comes to length and cost, so i am looking into that
I will warn, this is not the prettiest code, I did this project a little rushed and there is tons of abstraction that could be done, lots of repeat declarations/ functions etc
I will update this closer to submision
When running my own hardcoded examples of puzzle, i find optimality through astar and ucost, cant find it for the puzzle given in the homework
